Subject: [PATCH 05/50] Add warning about using server_port as 993 (imaps isn't
 supported) to log output so it's harder to miss such mistakes

+	* Added several warnings that try to catch the case where someone
+          tries to set the server_port to 993, which is usually a mistaken
+          use of TLS/SSL (port 993 is usually for imaps, which is not
+          supported; IMAP Proxy supports STARTTLS from a "normal" port,
+          which is usually 143)
